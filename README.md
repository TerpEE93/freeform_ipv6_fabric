# freeform_ipv6_fabric
Apstra Freeform desgn to deploy an EVPN-VXLAN overlay on an IPv6-only underlay

Built from Apstra 4.1.2

At some point I'll add some useful instructions here, or maybe a HOWTO doc.

There is no warranty, expressed or implied, with this repo. You get what you
pay for, and what you see here is free. Use carefully, and at your own risk.

To Do:
- Auto-generate ESI and LACP System ID's
- Add tentant (VRF) and VLAN configs
- Generate IRB's for routed VLANs from the VLAN config
- Other stuff I'm not thinking of right now...
