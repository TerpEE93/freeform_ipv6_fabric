# Release Notes
Just trying to keep track of changes as they're made.

## Version 0.1.3
Bug fixes only:
- Removed `vrf-target auto` from the configuration of the VSWITCH instance
  generated by the `junos_routing_instances.jinja` template.
- Along those lines... We now allocate route targets per VNI in the VSWITCH
  instance.  Updated the config in the `junos_routing_instances.jinja` template.
- Completely missed the `junos_system.jinja` file.  It's included in the
  package now.
- A routing instance of type mac-vrf must have interfaces attached to the
  virtual switching instance.  If a leaf device was provisioned without host
  interfaces (e.g., just setting up the fabric-facing interfaces), then the
  commit would fail.  Updated `junos_routing_instances.jinja` to make sure
  VLANs are applied to host interfaces on leaf devices before building out
  the VSWITCH routing instance, since that is our mac-vrf instance.
- Fixed `junos_protocols.jinja` so that we only configure IRB interfaces
  under `[edit protocols router-advertisement ]` if the IRB is configured
  on the device.

## Version 0.1.2
Bug fixes only:
- The template for the `BGP-AOS-Policy` was missing term 20, which matched
  on protocol BGP and accepted the routes.  This was preventing spine
  devices from forwarding BGP-learned routes between leafs.
- Cleaned up the resrouce generators to use `lacp_system_ids` for both the
  ESI and LACP system ID values on a LAG bundle.  The old ESI generator
  was still being used in the interface template to generate the ESI value
  on the LAG, and the check was failing (since the resource generator no
  longer existed).  ESI values are now properly generated from the
  `lacp_system_ids` resource generator.

## Version 0.1.1
Bug fixes only:
- Fixed closing braces on LAG member interfaces (one closing brace was missing).
- Added host-facing interfaces to the mac-vrf (virtual switch) instance under
  the `[edit routing-instances]` container on leaf devices.
- Added loopback interfaces to the L3 (instance-type vrf)routing instances.
  These lo0 interfaces use link-local scoped addresses only.  They are
  necessary for protocol support in the routing instance.  These were
  previously missing.
- Added the IRB interfaces in each L3 instance under the
  [ edit prototocl router-advertisement ] container.  These were previously
  missing.
- Moved replace: tag on routing-instances from the top of the container
  to the individual routing instances.  Oops, I wiped out mgmt_junos...
- Added the `default-gateway do-not-advertise` and `extended-vni-list all`
  statements under the `[edit routing-instances VSWITCH protcols evpn]`
  container.
- VLANs and their associated IRB interfaces are only generated on the devices
  where the VLANs are applied.
- Setting the MAC address on the IRB interfaces consistent with the setting
  in the Apstra reference design.

## Version 0.1
Initial release.  Deploys a 3-stage fabric with an IPv6-only underlay, to
include all fabric links and loopback interfaces.  The overlay VXLANs can
be L2-only, IPv4 edge-routed, or IPv6 edge-routed.
